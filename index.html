  <!-- About -->
  <section id="about">
    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      I am a graduate student in Health Informatics with a background in community health and
      data science. My academic and professional experience centers on analyzing healthcare data,
      supporting research initiatives, and understanding how informatics systems influence
      clinical and public health outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Previously, I contributed to healthcare research projects at the University of Illinois,
      working with large datasets related to health behaviors and patient outcomes. I have also
      developed applied machine learning models for chronic disease risk prediction and gained
      hands-on exposure to regulated clinical workflows through pharmacy operations. I am
      particularly interested in roles that combine healthcare data, informatics systems, and
      analytics to improve efficiency, quality, and decision-making.
